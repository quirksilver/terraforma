Wonder Games #antholojam project

This is the source code for A Planet Wakes, which can be played for free here: http://www.antholojam.com/gamesite/apw.html

A Planet Wakes was built for a month-long game jam, although general fiddling with the project went on until January 1 2015. Being jam code, there are some occasional strange and questionable choices in the code, but that's half the fun! Hopefully someone finds it useful and interesting
